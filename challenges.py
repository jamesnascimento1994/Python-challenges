# Starter Code
# def multiply(a, b):
#     a * b

# Solution
# def multiply(a, b):
#     return a * b

# # TESTS
# print(multiply(7, 8));
# print(multiply(4, 3));
# print(multiply(10, 5));

# Challenge Two: We want an array, but not just any old array, an array with contents! Write a function that produces an array with the numbers 0 to N-1 in it.
# Challenge Source: https://www.codewars.com/kata/571d42206414b103dc0006a1/python

# def arr(n=None): 
#     new_array = []
#     if n == None:
#         return []
#     for x in range(n):
#         new_array.append(x)
#     return new_array

# # TESTS
# print(arr(5));
# print(arr(7));
# print(arr(8));
